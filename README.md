# MARK - Easy BigData Ranking
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RUCD/mark.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RUCD/mark)

The **Multi Agent Ranking Framework** allows to easily implement large scale detection and ranking systems. It provides you with all necessary mechanisms: **storage, visualization and triggering**, such that you can focus on the real important stuff: detection algorithms.
