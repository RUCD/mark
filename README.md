# MARK - Easy BigData Ranking
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RUCD/mark.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RUCD/mark)

The **multi-agent ranking framework (MARK)** aims to provide all the building blocks that are required to build large scale detection and ranking systems. Namely, the framework provides the following key components: a **distributed storage** suited for very large datasets and BigData applications, a **web based visualization and management interface**, a **compute grid** to reliably execute the detection algorithms and balance the compute load between multiple servers, and an easy to configure **triggering mechanism** that allows to execute the detection algorithms when new data is available or when configured conditions are met. All these components are implemented in a generic way. They are independent of the type of data that will be processed by the framework. This allows the data scientist to focus on his core business: developing effective detection algorithms.
